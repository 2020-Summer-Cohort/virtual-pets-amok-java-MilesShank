// -Application class needs fleshed out with main method and game loop
// -The tests you wrote are generally solid, however we need more coverage, particularly in your VirtualPetShelter
// -PetHealthCalculator is not necessary (although not hurting anything if you wish to keep it)
// -Since OrganicDog and OrganicCat have identical feed() methods, that behavior could be put in the OrganicPet super class. Look
//  for instances of duplicate code like this and see if you can structure your program so you only have to write it once
